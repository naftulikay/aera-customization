# Pickguard Tracing for AeÌˆra

JPG, TIFF, and PDFs available at both 300 and 600 DPI. A 1cm by 1cm guide is included in the scan, and I was able to 
reproduce the document to scale on Linux by printing the 600 DPI PDF, making sure that page scaling is *off*, and that
the print is centered on the page. The trace was created by purchasing a Taylor acoustic pickguard and tracing with a
Pilot G2 Bold (10) point pen.
